This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project initialised to my own preference.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Feel free to clone/copy/destroy.
